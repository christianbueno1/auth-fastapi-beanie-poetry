### Domain-Driven Architecture of File Structure

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software design approach that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create software that accurately reflects complex business requirements. The key concept in DDD is to model the software's structure and behavior based on the domain model.

In a domain-driven architecture, the file structure is organized around the domain concepts rather than technical layers. Here is an overview of how you can structure your files in a domain-driven manner:

#### Key Concepts of DDD

1. **Domain**: The problem space or the business area for which the software is being developed.
2. **Entities**: Objects with a distinct identity that persists over time.
3. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that are defined by their attributes.
4. **Aggregates**: A cluster of entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit.
5. **Repositories**: Interfaces for accessing aggregates from a data store.
6. **Services**: Operations that don't naturally fit within entities or value objects.
7. **Modules**: Logical groupings of related classes to ensure high cohesion.
8. **Factories**: Methods or classes for creating aggregates.

### Explanation

- **app/domain/**: Contains the core business logic and domain models.
  - **user/** and **todo/**: Each subdirectory represents a different domain context (or bounded context) within the application.
    - **models.py**: Defines the entities, value objects, and aggregates.
    - **repositories.py**: Defines interfaces for accessing domain objects.
    - **services.py**: Contains domain services that encapsulate business logic.
    - **factories.py**: Provides factory methods for creating aggregates.

- **app/infrastructure/**: Contains implementation details and infrastructure concerns.
  - **db/**: Setup for the database using Beanie ODM.
  - **repositories/**: Concrete implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.

- **app/api/**: Contains the API layer, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
  - **routes/**: Defines the FastAPI routes.
  - **controllers/**: Handles the incoming requests and delegates to the appropriate services.

- **app/schemas/**: Contains Pydantic models for request and response validation.

- **app/utils/**: Utility functions and classes used throughout the application.

### Advantages of Domain-Driven Architecture

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: By organizing code around domain concepts, it ensures a clear separation between business logic and technical details.
2. **Scalability**: Easier to scale the application by adding new bounded contexts or modules.
3. **Maintainability**: High cohesion within modules and low coupling between them makes the codebase easier to maintain.
4. **Alignment with Business Requirements**: Ensures that the software structure closely reflects the business domain, making it easier to understand and evolve.

By following a domain-driven architecture, you can build robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications that accurately reflect the business requirements and complexities.
