## Domain-driven structure

This ASCII tree represents the same directory structure as your original selection, but uses ASCII characters to show the hierarchy and relationships between directories and files.

Yes, you're correct. The structure you're referring to is a different approach to organizing a project, often referred to as a "domain-driven" structure. In this structure, the code is organized around the business domain, which can make it easier to understand and maintain.

In the previous structure, the `routes`, `models`, and `services` directories each contained separate directories for `users` and `products`. This means that all the code related to users (the routes, models, and services) is grouped together in one place, and the same for products. This can make it easier to understand the code related to a specific domain.

In the structure from the active file, the `routes`, `models`, and `services` directories are at the same level, and each contains files related to different domains. This means that the code related to a specific functionality (like routing, database models, or business logic) is grouped together, regardless of which domain it relates to.

Both structures have their advantages and can be appropriate in different situations. The best choice depends on the specific needs and preferences of your project and team.

## Layered or Horizontal structure

Yes, the structure from the active file is often referred to as a "layered" or "horizontal" structure. In this structure, the code is organized by its technical role in the application, such as routing, data modeling, or business logic. Each layer can contain code related to multiple domains.

Here's a breakdown of the structure:

- `my_auth_api/`: This is the root directory of your project. It contains all the files and directories related to your project.

- `app/`: This is where the main application code lives. 

  - `__init__.py`: This is an empty file that Python requires to recognize the directory as a Python package.

  - `main.py`: This is typically the entry point of the application, where the app instance is created and routes are registered.

  - `config.py`: This file is used to manage configuration settings for the application.

  - `models/`: This directory contains the data models for your application. Each file in this directory typically corresponds to a different domain of your application.

  - `routes/`: This directory contains the route definitions for your application. Each file in this directory typically corresponds to a different domain of your application.

  - `services/`: This directory contains the business logic of your application. Each file in this directory typically corresponds to a different domain of your application.

  - `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions and classes that are used throughout your application.

- `tests/`: This directory contains all the test files and test cases for your application.

- `pyproject.toml`: This file is used to manage project dependencies and settings for Python's built-in project management tool, Poetry.

- `README.md`: This file typically contains information about your project, such as how to install and run it, and how to contribute to it.

This structure helps to keep the codebase organized and easy to navigate, especially as the application grows. It also makes it easier to manage and isolate different parts of the application.
